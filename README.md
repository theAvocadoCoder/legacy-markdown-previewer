## Reflection
---

This was a 2-day project completed as part of the projects requirements for the FreeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Cerification.

I set out to build an application that receives marked up text, parses it and displayes the rendered markdown. I accomplished this with the aid of the React Markdown parser.

I started with the create-react-app boilerplate, including the React Mardown parser and building my components on top of that foundation.

The biggest challenge I faced was implementing the live Preview. I do not believe I fully overcame that, as the preview is still one character later than the input. I'm open to suggestions and corrections.
